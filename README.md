# Food-Recognition

##Objective
In this project we tackle the problem of recognizing a food item from an image and subsequently measuring the calorie intake from the image of the dishes being consumed. This part deals with only recognising the food item. The work here has been done on identifying rice, bread, puri, idli and dosa, all of which are Indian cuisine. This project finds application in the area of health data analytics, where dieticians can recommend their patients the calorie intake, and the patients by using an app can take the photo of the meal they consume and keep track of their calorie in take.
